# Training a Custom PyTorch Classifier on Medical MNIST Dataset
<p>This project is a solution to one of the projects at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/fr-fr/">Nvidia</a></p>

<h3>Context of the project</h3>

<p>A start-up has won a call for tenders to produce a POC (Proof Of Concept) for an AI solution capable of classifying radio images into six categories.</p>

<p>My objective as an IA developer is to prove the technical skills of the start-up to carry out this project and to get the medical profession to join the Health Data Hub project.</p>

<p>As the Health Data Hub is being implemented, the company uses the MedNIST dataset. In this project, we will classify images from the MNIST medical dataset. In fact, we are going to train a custom PyTorch classifier on the MNIST Medical dataset.</p>

<p>The dataset available for image classification consists of images stored in corresponding folders. For example, our dataset consists of 6 types of images and they are stored in corresponding folders.</p>

<p>We will use Kaggle's MNIST Medical dataset to train our custom PyTorch image classifier. All images are 64×64 grayscale images.</p>

<p>The MNIST Medical dataset contains 58954 images with dimensions 64×64. All images are in grayscale format and there are 6 classes in total. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AbdomenCT – 10000 images</li>
<li>BreastMRI – 8954 images</li>
<li>CXR (Chest X-Ray) – 10000 frames</li>
<li>ChestCT – 10000 images</li>
<li>Hand – 10000 images</li>
<li>HeadCT – 10000 images</li>
</ul>
