# Training_a_Custom_PyTorch_Classifier_on_Medical_MNIST_Dataset

<p><B>Key words</B>: Classification radio images, PyTorch, CNN, MNIST Medical dataset</p>

<h3>Context of the project</h3>

<p>A start-up has won a call for tenders to produce a POC (Proof Of Concept) for an AI solution capable of classifying radio images into six categories.</p>

<p>My objective as an IA developer is to prove the technical skills of the start-up to carry out this project and to get the medical profession to join the Health Data Hub project.</p>

<p>As the Health Data Hub is being implemented, the company uses the MedNIST dataset. In this project, we will classify images from the MNIST medical dataset. In fact, we are going to train a custom PyTorch classifier on the MNIST Medical dataset.</p>
